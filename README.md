Coding Challenge: NYC Schools
GOAL: Verify candidate can provide a technical solution and follow instructions
REQUIREMENTS:
These requirements are rather high-level and vague. If details are omitted, it is
because we will be happy with any of a wide variety of solutions. Don't worry about
finding "the" solution. Feel free to be creative with the requirements. Your goal is to
impress (but do so with clean code).
